# MongoDB Query Error with $in Operator

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries. The error occurs when the field being queried is not an array, causing the query to fail.

## Bug

The bug lies in the following query:

```javascript
const query = {
  field: { $in: [1, 2, 3] },
};

// This query will throw an error if the field is not an array
db.collection.find(query).toArray();
```

If the `field` in the documents is not an array, this query will throw an error.  The correct way to handle this depends on your data and expected behavior.  You may need to adjust your query to handle cases where the `field` might not be an array.

## Solution

The solution involves adding a check to ensure the field is an array before applying the query.  If it's not an array, a different query should be used, possibly returning an empty array or a specific default result.
